      Access to the <span class="highlight">fund</span>
    </h1>
    <p class="description">
      This fund began as a <strong>personal project</strong> I developed alongside my full-time studies. Over time, its <strong>performance</strong> has demonstrated that it deserves to be taken seriously.<br><br>
      Currently, the fund is <strong>private</strong> and accessible only to a select group of individuals. The purpose of this website is to showcase its performance and <strong>gauge broader interest</strong>. I'm curious to see if others would be willing to <strong>invest</strong> in it.<br><br>
      If you're interested in potentially participating, I’ve created a <strong>Google Form</strong> where you can <strong>express interest</strong> and leave your contact details. Should spots open up, I’ll reach out to those who have submitted.
