    <p class="description">
      This fund began as a personal project I developed alongside my full-time studies.
      Over time, its <strong>performance</strong> has demonstrated that it deserves to be taken seriously.<br><br>
      Currently, the fund is <strong>private</strong> and accessible only to a select group of individuals.
      The purpose of this website is to showcase its performance and gauge broader interest. I'm curious to see if others would be willing to invest in it.<br><br>
      If you're interested in potentially participating, I’ve created a Google Form where you can <strong>express interest</strong> and leave your contact details.
      Should spots open up, I’ll reach out to those who have submitted. <br><br>

      Please leave your email in the form. I’ll send the slide deck to investors committing <strong>a minimum of $100,000</strong> to the fund.
      The deck provides a detailed overview of the strategy, the key risks, and the measures in place to mitigate them.
