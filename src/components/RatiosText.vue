      The chart shows performance of Schep Capital if you had invested 100,000$
      at the inception date of <strong>June 1st 2024</strong>. The SP500 is outperformed, both in
      terms of profit and risk taken relative to that profit, as indicated by the <strong>superior</strong> Sortino
      and Sterling ratio achieved by the <strong>strategy</strong> of the fund.
    </p>
<!--    <p>-->
<!--      The Schep Capital fund has a <strong>significantly higher</strong> Sortino ratio than the S&P 500 since June 2024, -->
<!--      indicating that the risk taken relative to the achieved returns is far more favorable. The Sterling ratio reinforces -->
<!--      this assessment, using <strong>maximum drawdown</strong> as a measure of downside risk. While the strategy employed -->
<!--      by Schep Capital may exhibit higher volatility, this is <strong>justified</strong> by its exceptional returns.-->
