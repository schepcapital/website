      The Schep Capital fund has a <strong>significantly higher</strong> Sortino ratio than the S&P 500 since June 2024, indicating that the risk taken relative to the achieved returns is far more favorable. The Sterling ratio reinforces this assessment, using <strong>maximum drawdown</strong> as a measure of downside risk. While the strategy employed by Schep Capital may exhibit higher volatility, this is <strong>justified</strong> by its exceptional returns.
