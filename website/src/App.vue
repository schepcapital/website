        This table displays the historical returns generated by the trading strategy in terms of <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.
        The strategy was deployed in the real world at the beginning of <strong>June 2024</strong>.<br><br>
        It is built on the <strong>core belief</strong> that accumulating more Bitcoin over time is a powerful path to long-term wealth.<br><br>
        Combining increased Bitcoin holdings with a rise in Bitcoin's USD price results in <strong>exponential growth</strong> during bull markets and helps <strong>mitigate losses</strong> during bear markets.<br><br>
        Over the long run, this approach significantly outperforms <strong>traditional</strong> investment methods.

        This second table presents historical returns in terms of <strong>USDT</strong>, which is ultimately what matters most to investors.
        While the trading strategy isn't explicitly optimized for USDT returns, the results shown are nonetheless impressive.<br><br>
        <strong>Substantial risk appetite</strong> is a key requirement for those considering this fund, as it aims to deliver <strong>tremendous returns</strong>.<br>
        The strategy is designed to capture <strong>extraordinary gains</strong> that more than offset any losing trades.<br><br>
        Operating strictly within the crypto market and being <strong>fully automated</strong>, the strategy is built to detect major market moves early and exit quickly with minimal losses if the trend goes against it.<br><br>
        As such, this fund <strong>thrives in volatility</strong>â€”a defining characteristic of the crypto market.
