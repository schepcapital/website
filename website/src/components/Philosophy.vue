      <p>
        Financial markets are vastly complex and their behaviour changes constantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any single human is overflooded with information and is not able to take in all data available due to the vastness of data available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some patterns are so complex and temporarily exploitable that only machines can use these opportunities properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans have emotions â€” something which is a liability when it comes to disciplined trading and making rational decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Machines have speed to their advantage too, faster than any human could possibly be.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is why I believe in algorithmic trading, carefully crafted, updated and tested by myself.
